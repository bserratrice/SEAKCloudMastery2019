Custom Branding on vCD with APIs
Authentication with  Postman

Let's launch POSTMAN at the desktop first.

Next, let's get the session token for accessing the vCD API. Let's refer to the documentation link below. As we are using vCD 9.7, we will be using vCloud API 32.0

https://docs.vmware.com/en/vCloud-Director/index.html

Let's create a new POST with URL https://vcd-01a.corp.local/api/sessions

In Headers session, Accept header: application/*+;version=32.0

Under Authorization, choose Basic Auth and put in the username and password as shown below

Click Send, and then go to Headers. Your Status should be 200 OK

Take note of the X-VMWARE-VCLOUD-ACCESS-TOKEN, you will need it later

Customize Portal Name and Color

To configure the Portal Name and Color, you will need to make a PUT request to vCloud Director as below; Make sure that the Headers is json and the request is https://FQDN/cloudapi/branding

Go to Authorization TAB , change the type to Bearer Token and copy the Token from earlier to here

Next, go to Body TAB and  you got to input the code, feel free to change the color to anything else you preferred and if you don't like the theme to be Default, you can change it to Dark. Click Send and refresh the browser.

{

 "portalName": "Cloud Mastery",

 "portalColor": "#588BAE",

 "selectedTheme": {

   "themeType": "BUILT_IN",

   "name": "Default"

 }

}
Customize Links

Now let's try putting links into the portal; Let's check the current portal first. Notice that there is is only User preferences, Change Password, Feedback and Log out

Add the additional code below and append to your above exercise and click Send (look out for the comma)

{

 "portalName": "Cloud Mastery",

 "portalColor": "#588BAE",

 "selectedTheme": {

   "themeType": "BUILT_IN",

   "name": "Default"

 },

 "customLinks": [

   {

     "name": "github",

     "menuItemType": "link",

     "url": "https://github.com/vmkube/SEAKCloudMastery2019"

   }

 ]

}

This will be how it looks like at the end, try clicking the link.
Customize Logo

To change the Logo, let's do a new PUT request as shown below. This time the content type will be png nd the request is https://FQDN/cloudapi/branding/logo
Cloudmastery

Go to Body and select binary and then add the png image  from Downloads
Cloudmastery

Send the Request and refresh the browser. You should be able to see the logo now
